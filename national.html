          <h3>Government Unveils Comprehensive Policy to Tackle Unemployment</h3>
          <p>In a major step to address unemployment and bolster skill development, the government has announced a comprehensive National Employment and Skill Development Policy aimed at creating 10 million jobs over the next five years. Launched by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, this policy seeks to tackle the unemployment crisis exacerbated by the pandemic and leverage the potential of the country’s young population. According to official estimates, the policy will allocate substantial funding to key sectors including manufacturing, technology, and renewable energy, all projected to be high-growth areas in the coming decade.
            <br><br>
            At the policy announcement, the Labour Minister emphasized the government's commitment to job creation through sustainable practices and technology-driven growth.<i>“We are dedicated to creating a future where every citizen has access to quality jobs, and every youth has the skills to thrive in an evolving job market,” </i> said the Minister. As part of the initiative, the government plans to introduce tax incentives for companies that prioritize skill training programs, apprenticeships, and internships for young job seekers. Additionally, over 1,000 skill centers will be set up nationwide, targeting rural and underserved communities.
            <br><br>Economic analysts have expressed optimism about the policy's potential to create a skilled workforce capable of supporting critical sectors like information technology, healthcare, and green energy. Economist Dr. Ramesh Singh said, <i>“If implemented effectively, this policy could address the nation’s skill gap and empower millions to secure stable employment.”</i> However, he also cautioned that transparent monitoring and collaboration with private stakeholders will be crucial to ensure that funds are used effectively and that training meets industry demands.
            <br><br>
            Student unions and youth representatives are largely supportive but have raised concerns over the accessibility of these programs. Priya Das, a representative of the National Youth Forum, stated,<i> “It’s an encouraging step, but we must ensure that rural areas receive equal access to these opportunities, so no community is left behind.”</i>
            <br><br>
            Critics, however, have raised questions regarding funding transparency and the challenges of implementing skill development programs on a national scale. They argue that without robust infrastructure in rural areas, the program’s reach may be limited, potentially widening the urban-rural employment gap. A few opposition leaders also expressed concerns, calling for an independent monitoring body to oversee fund allocation and the impact of training programs on job creation.
            <br><br>
            This policy's success is poised to hinge on several factors, including effective collaboration between the government and private sector, timely fund distribution, and a data-driven approach to skill training. If achieved, experts believe the policy could reshape the country’s employment landscape and strengthen economic resilience.

        <h3>Supreme Court's Landmark Judgment: Relief for Aggrieved Homebuyers</h3>
        <p>In a significant judgment that strengthens homebuyers' rights, the Supreme Court of India, in the case M/s. Newtech Promoters and Developers Pvt. Ltd. vs. State of UP & Ors., reaffirmed the retroactive nature of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA). Delivered on November 11, 2021, the ruling underscores the consumer-focused purpose of RERA and its mandate to protect homebuyers against real estate delays and mismanagement.
            <br><br>
                            The judgment holds special relevance for members of the ITD Homes Welfare Society (ITDHWS), who have been awaiting the launch of their long-promised housing project under Delhi’s Land Pooling Policy. Initiated in 2014 and scheduled for completion by 2018-19, the project remains stalled, leaving 46 members in distress with unfulfilled promises.
                           <br><br>
                            <i>Decade-Long Delays and Allegations of Mismanagement</i>
                            <br><br>
                            The ITDHWS project, advertised as an affordable housing initiative, has seen no progress nearly a decade after its announcement. The society faces multiple allegations, including:
                            <br><br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Non-compliance with RERA: The project was not registered under RERA, violating legal requirements.
                            <li>Misuse of funds: Members allege that funds collected for the project have been misappropriated. Fund diverted in relatives accounts by carving out cash and black money transaction were done. 
                                </li>
                                <li>Administrative lapses: The society reportedly skipped elections for office bearers and disregarded protests raised by members during general body meetings.</li>
                            </li>
                        
                        
                        </ul>
                            <br>
                            The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) has filed an FIR against the society, while a protest petition has been lodged against a partial closure report submitted in the case.
                            <br><br>
                            <u><i>Key Legal Interpretations on RERA Applicability</i></u>
                            <br><br>
                            The Supreme Court’s judgment in Newtech clarifies that RERA applies retroactively to ongoing and future projects registered after the enactment of the Act. Paragraph 54 of the ruling notes:
                           <br><br> <i>"From the scheme of the Act 2016, its application is retroactive in character... it will apply after getting the ongoing projects and future projects registered under Section 3 to prospectively follow the mandate of the Act 2016."</i>
            <br><br>        As the IT Residency Project remains incomplete and unregistered despite being initiated in 2013, it falls under RERA’s jurisdiction and must be treated as an ongoing project.
            <br><br>
                            Further, under Section 2(zk) of RERA, cooperative housing societies like ITDHWS are defined as "promoters," a classification reaffirmed in several legal precedents, including:
                            <br><br><ol type="1">
                                <li>Air Force Naval Housing Board Case: The Allahabad High Court held that welfare societies engaged in real estate development are deemed "promoters" under RERA, regardless of their registration under the Societies Registration Act, 1860.
                                   </li>
                                   <br>
                                   <li>Jeevan Ashray Welfare Society Case: In May 2023, the Real Estate Appellate Tribunal, NCT of Delhi, ruled that societies registered under the Societies Registration Act or similar enactments cannot misuse their registration to escape RERA accountability. The Tribunal observed that many such entities exploit regulatory gaps to enrich themselves at the expense of buyers’ rights.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <br>
                            <u><i>Implications for Homebuyers and Real Estate Developers</i></u>
                            <br><br>The judgments expose loopholes in the Societies Registration Act and highlight the misuse of welfare society registrations to evade regulatory oversight. These rulings emphasize stricter enforcement of RERA provisions, ensuring that all developers—whether individuals, companies, or cooperative societies—are held accountable.<br><br>
                            For homebuyers, the Newtech judgment and related rulings offer a strong legal basis to seek redress, including refunds with interest, compensation for delays, and compliance enforcement. The ITDHWS case stands as a precedent, ensuring similar disputes are resolved in favor of consumers.
                           <br><br>
                            <b><u>Conclusion</u></b>
                            <br><br>
                            The Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Newtech and the Tribunal’s findings in Jeevan Ashray Welfare Society vs. Diwakar Garg & Others underline the urgent need for accountability in real estate. As investigations into ITDHWS by EOW and RERA proceedings continue, the members of the society remain hopeful for long-overdue justice and compensation for years of frustration and financial loss.

          <h3>Police Launch Crackdown on Rising Cybercrime in Metro Area</h3>
          <p>
            The Metropolitan Police Department has unveiled an aggressive new strategy to combat an alarming surge in cybercrime, as digital fraud cases in the region have skyrocketed by over 30% since January. The comprehensive initiative includes the formation of a specialized cyber task force and extensive public awareness campaigns targeting vulnerable populations.
            <br>
            <i>"We're witnessing an unprecedented rise in sophisticated cyber attacks targeting our residents,"</i> said Police Commissioner David Martinez at yesterday's press conference. <i>"In the past six months alone, our cybercrime unit has received more than 2,000 complaints related to online fraud, phishing schemes, and identity theft."</i>
        <br><br>The surge has particularly impacted senior citizens, who have lost an estimated $3.2 million to various online scams this year. Sarah Thompson, 68, fell victim to a sophisticated phone banking scam last month<i>"They knew details about my bank that made them seem legitimate," she shared.</i><i>"Before I realized what was happening, they had emptied my savings account."</i>
            <br><br>The newly established Cyber Task Force, comprising 15 specialized officers and digital forensics experts, will operate 24/7 to investigate and respond to cybercrime reports. Deputy Chief of Cyber Operations Jennifer Chen explained, <i>"Our team combines traditional police work with cutting-edge digital investigation techniques. We're now better equipped to track and apprehend these cyber criminals."</i>
            <br><br>
            Key elements of the police crackdown include:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Rapid response protocols for active cyber fraud cases
                </li>
                <li>Enhanced digital forensics capabilities
                </li>
                <li>Partnership with local banks for early fraud detection
                </li>
                <li>Free cybersecurity workshops in community centers
                </li>
                <li>Dedicated helpline for reporting cyber crimes
                </li>
            </ul>
           Local cybersecurity expert Dr. Marcus Wilson from Metro University emphasized the evolving nature of these threats.<i>"Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods, including AI-powered scams and deepfake technology. Regular updates to personal security measures are no longer optional – they're essential."</i>
            <br><br>
            The police department has partnered with local senior centers and community organizations to conduct awareness sessions. <i>"Prevention is our best defense,"</i> stated Officer James Rodriguez, who leads the community outreach program<i>"We're teaching residents how to spot common scam indicators and protect their personal information."</i>
            <br><br>
            Recent investigations have revealed several organized crime networks operating from overseas, making prosecution challenging. However, international cooperation has led to several successful interventions. Last week, the task force successfully prevented a $500,000 wire fraud attempt targeting a local business.
            <br><br>The department urges residents to:
           <br><ul>
                <li>Enable two-factor authentication on all accounts
                </li>
                <li>Verify suspicious emails and phone calls independently
                </li>
                <li>Report unusual online activity immediately
                </li>
                <li>Keep software and security systems updated
                </li>
                <li>Attend local cybersecurity awareness workshops
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            Citizens can report cybercrime incidents through the newly launched online portal or contact the 24-hour cybercrime helpline. The police department emphasizes that prompt reporting significantly increases the chances of recovering stolen funds and preventing further crimes.
