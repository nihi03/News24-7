      <h3>Health Issue News Report: Delhi's Air Pollution Crisis</h3>
      <p text-align="justified"><b>Introduction</b>
        <br>
        Delhi is grappling with a severe air pollution crisis, creating a major health emergency for its residents. As part of my research, I've explored how this alarming situation is impacting the health of millions, overburdening hospitals, and disrupting daily life.
        <br><br>
        <i>Impact on People's Health</i>
        <br><br>
        The air quality in Delhi has plummeted to hazardous levels, causing widespread health problems. Hospitals report a 30% surge in emergency cases, with respiratory issues being the most common complaints. Here are some of the major health effects:
        <br>
        <ul type="1">
            <li>Breathing difficulties and chest tightness.
            </li>
            <li>Persistent coughing, often leading to medical intervention.
            </li>
            <li>Worsening conditions for people with asthma.
            </li>
            <li>Increased cases of bronchitis and even pneumonia, particularly in children and the elderly.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <i>Who is Most Affected?</i>
        <br>
        From my analysis of AIIMS reports, two vulnerable groups are suffering the most:
        <br><ol type="1">
            <li>Young children, whose immune systems are not fully developed, are increasingly falling sick.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Elderly individuals and those with pre-existing health conditions are experiencing life-threatening complications.</li>
    </ol>	
<br>
        <i>Effects on Daily Life and Economy</i><br><br>
        The crisis is not just a public health issue but also a severe economic and social challenge:
        <br><ul>
            <li><b>Economic loss: </b>Delhi is losing an estimated â‚¹150 crore daily due to reduced productivity.</li>
            <br><li><b>Missed work: </b>Many residents are unable to attend work because of illness.</li>
            <br><li><b>Business disruption:</b>Outdoor businesses and vendors report declining profits.</li>
            <br><li><b>Medical expenses:</b> Families face mounting healthcare costs, and hospitals are overwhelmed.</li>
        </ul>
    <br>
        <i>Safety Measures for Citizens</i><br><br>
        Experts recommend several steps to minimize health risks:
        <br>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Avoid outdoor activities during peak pollution hours (early morning and evening).</li>
        <li>Wear N95 masks when stepping outside.</li>
        <li>Use air purifiers at home and work.</li>
        <li>Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water.</li>
        <li>Seek immediate medical help for any respiratory symptoms.</li>
        <li>Government and Judicial Actions</li>
    </ol>
        The Supreme Court and local authorities are enforcing strict pollution control measures under GRAP (Graded Response Action Plan) Stage 4:
        <ul>
            <li>Sprinkling water on roads to reduce dust.
            </li>
            <li>Halting most construction activities.
            </li>
            <li>Restricting vehicle movement and enhancing inspections of trucks entering the city.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <b><u>Conclusion</u></b><br><br>
        Delhi's air pollution crisis is a pressing health and environmental issue requiring immediate and sustained action. Courts, healthcare institutions, and individuals are making efforts to address the problem, but this situation underscores the urgent need for stronger environmental policies to ensure healthier urban living.
